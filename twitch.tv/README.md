#### Purpose
When you follow so many channels on twitch, some small streamers are hidden in the default list since twitch sort the followed channels by the current live viewers.

This script is to add two buttons in the nav bar of twitch to filter your followed channels and move all your specified favorite channels in the top of the list and change their live icon to a big yellow circle instead of the default red.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Button Name</th>
      <th>Function</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>FAVORITE</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Expand all live channels and move all the specified favorite channels at the top of the list.</li>
          <li>Change the live icon from red circle to a larger yellow circle</li>
          <li>Limit the count of the displayed channels</li>
        </ul>
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>LIVE</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Display all live channels including the ones hidden by the count limit in the Favorite button</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
